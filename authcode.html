<h1>Authcode BruteForce</h1><br>
We need to brute force an HTTP authentication prompt.<br>
When looking at the headers we see that the password is passed only as an authcode that is sent as
username:password base64 encoded.
<br>
We can't easily use hydra or ncrack as we have no values to pass..<br>
<br>
We know the format is create a custom wordlist and base64 the output then send this to the Intruder module of BurpSuite.
<br>
For this inital test lets start with the username of 'admin' so we add "admin:" to the start of each line of the password file.<br>
<br>
sed -i 's/^/admin:/' INPUTFILE.TXT
<br>
Now we have the formatting correct lets read each line of the inputfile and convert each line to base64. 
Then lets output this to a new file.
<br>
while read line; do echo -n  $line | base64 >> OUTPUT-FILE.txt ; done < INPUTFILE.txt
<br>
 Now we can run this with BurpSuite Intruder and find the password.
