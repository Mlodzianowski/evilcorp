<h1>Authcode BruteForce</h1><br>
We need to brute force an HTTP authentication prompt.<br>
When looking at the headers we see that the password is passed only as an authcode that is sent as
username:password base64 encoded.
<br>
We can't easily use hydra or ncrack as we have no values to pass..<br>
<br>
We know the format is create a custom wordlist and base64 the output then send this to the Intruder module of BurpSuite.
<br>
For this inital test lets start with the username of 'admin' so we add "admin:" to the start of each line of the password file.<br>
<br>
sed -i 's/^/admin:/' INPUTFILE.TXT
<br>
Now we have the formatting correct lets read each line of the inputfile and convert each line to base64. 
Then lets output this to a new file.
<br>
while read line; do echo -n  $line | base64 >> OUTPUT-FILE.txt ; done < INPUTFILE.txt
<br>
 Now we can run this with BurpSuite Intruder and find the password.
<br>

<H2> Brute-forcing-base64'd user+pass </H2><BR>
When we want to brute force a login but find the webserver uses basic authentication 
 and base 64 encodes the username and password with a seperator like ':' we can use burp to do solve this.<BR>
<br>
bobby:password
<br>
Goto Intruder keep with Sniper.
<br>
Select "Custom Iterator"
<br>
Under Position 1 add the word or words dependant on if we know the username or not.
<br>
Then add in the "Separator for position 1"  box the seperator used. so in most cases ':'
<br>
Next change the drop down under "Payload Options [Custom iterator]" to 2.
<br>
Next add the word-lists of words you want to try, or just the password if you know it and trying to work out the username.
<br>
If you are using a large list it will take a while. just be patient....
<br>
Next add a new rule for payload processing. select "Encode" --> "Base64-encode"
<br>
