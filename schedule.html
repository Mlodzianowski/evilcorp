                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This talk explores deploying and dynamically generating C2 services on Kubernetes! Everything will be extremely practical with walkthroughs of detailed deployment configurations. Building containers for popular C2 platforms, such as Cobalt Strike, and many others, will be covered. Rapidly deploying complex C2 infrastructure using tools such as Kops and Drone and managing DNS and TLS using Kubernetes will be discussed. Attendees will learn how to build complex redirecting logic to sandbag defenders, using the rewriting and filtering capabilities found in the Nginx Ingress Controller, and the Istio Service Mesh. In addition, monitoring the health of implants using Prometheus will be reviewed.<br><br>About <strong>Larry Suto</strong>: Larry is an independent security consultant based out of Oakland, CA.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The data center embodies the heart of many businesses on the Internet. It contains much of the information in a centralized location which provides a huge incentive for those who would wish harm. The data centers in the realm of Cloud may no longer contain just a single entity, but many individual tenants that attach to a common fabric. The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) aims to meet these needs with a multi-tenant, scalable fabric that interconnects physical hosts, VMs and containers. ACI is Cisco's answer to the centrally-managed Software Defined Network (SDN). The Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Nexus 9000 series switches form the brains and backbone of ACI. <br>A member of Cisco's Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) will demonstrate their findings during an evaluation of ACI and the APIC, more than three years before the BH2019 talk "APIC's Adventures in Wonderland." Step into the mind of an attacker and scan, probe, and interact with the network fabric to progress from an unauthenticated user to administrator and root of the data center switch fabric. Once inside the system, see how the APIC can be modified in a nearly undetectable manner to provide the attacker unfettered internal access to all the interconnected hosts and VMs in the data center. The target audience for this talk includes those with a technical interest in offensive discovery and secure product development. Participants will receive an overview of how a data center product is viewed in an offensive light.<br><br>About <strong>Chris McCoy</strong>: Chris is a technical leader in Cisco's Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) and published author of Security Penetration Testing, The Art of Hacking Series LiveLessons with Cisco Press.

The generated implants will blend-in as legitimate traffic by communicating to the infrastructure using SaaS channels (e.g. GMail, Twitter). Use your VPS/Domains battery to deploy staging servers and inject your favorite shellcode for interactive sessions, clone sites and hide your implants ready to be downloaded, deploy more redirectors if they get bustedâ SiestaTime is built entirely in Golang, with the ability to generate Implants for multiple platforms, interact with different OS resources, and perform efficient C2 communications.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">SaltStack is robust configuration management utility used by many to achieve DevOps related initiatives in their organizations. Thanks to its open source model, SaltStack can be used by both hobbyist, hackers, and corporations alike. Like any open source tool suite out there, that also means individuals with adversarial intent, be it professional, or malicious, can also take advantage of this tool. In its most simple case, SaltStack can be used by an adversary as a simple Command and Control server (C2 server). However, if SaltStack is used as intended, an educated adversary can easily turn salt âÃÃºbadâÃÃ¹ in more ways than simple command and control.<br>By re-configuring and automating basic settings within the Salt Master and Salt Minion configurations, it is easy to deploy SaltStack across many systems for any scenario. Coupling this ease of deployment with a basic understanding of configuration management, and scripted stagers, the result is a powerful post-exploitation framework with a built in C2 server, that is simply just SaltStack, but in use by an adversary. There are many benefits for using such a tool suite from an adversarial perspective such as, easily bypassing AV with trusted Salt Minions, and taking advantage of the desired state configurations to build out robust, scalable, post exploitation persistence modules.<br>Part of the research conducted was not just on how an adversary might use SaltStack, but also on how they might target a SaltStack environment. Man in the middle attacks are a concerning attack vector against Salt Minions at the time of this research. SaltStack has strong protections against this, but they are not enabled by default due to the need of manually distributing a unique public key. It is up to the individual(s) deploying SaltStack to be sure they enabled the proper security features to be safe from these attacks. Fortunately, SaltStack does have a few compensating controls that make this less likely after a successful deployment, but it is important that all SaltStack users are made aware of the importance and impact that just one particular setting can have on their infrastructure. Fortunately methods of detecting this activity are clear and well documented, but unfortunately a successful attack usually means root access on the target which could result in an adversary clearing their tracks. This could make it difficult to perform root cause analysis unless network traffic was analyzed at the time of the event.<br>The overall goal of this research is to show how advances in tools for perfectly legitimate Information Technology initiatives, like DevOps, can be turned into sophisticated tool suites for attackers. In true hacker spirit, this technology can be used for completely unintended purposes. This presentation will provide the insight to how SaltStack could be attacked or used in an adversarial context, and also how those attacks or uses could be detected and prevented.<br><br>About <strong>Casey Erdmann</strong>: Casey Erdmann, also known as 3ndG4me by his CTF team mates and online social communities, is an avid offensive security nerd.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Verizon's 2019 Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) indicates that malware is delivered via email in 94% of investigated breaches. Business Email Compromise (BEC) is on the rise. Phishing is still a problem for most organizations. A good phishing campaign is still an easy win for a Red Teamer, though itâÃÃ´s a constant cat-and-mouse game as email gateways deploy new techniques for anti-spoofing and malware detection. This talk will discuss research and browser/app testing around using Puny Code to create solid doppelganger domains for phishing campaigns, watering hole attacks and other creative shenanigans. Using techniques discussed in this talk, you all be able to clone your target's domain name(s) appearing identical to the naked eye. Passing SSL/TLS verification, bypassing security awareness training, and any in-house phishing campaigns your Blue Team might have implemented, this is a $12 technique you must see.<br><br>About <strong>Michael Wylie</strong>: Michael Wylie, MBA, CISSP is the Director of Cybersecurity Services at Richey May Technology Solutions.
